# Career-Engineered UX Portfolio

## Live Site
(Will be added after GitHub Pages is enabled)

## Project Purpose
This portfolio positions me as a research-driven UX Designer targeting NJ/NY product teams.

## Orchestration Log
During development, the AI initially suggested a heavier framework. I pivoted to a lightweight HTML/CSS structure to ensure faster deployment and recruiter accessibility via GitHub Pages.
