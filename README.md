## Project Purpose
This portfolio was built using a reverse-engineered orchestration workflow.

The goal is to position myself as a research-driven UX Designer targeting NYC/NJ product teams. Instead of beginning with code, I defined a clear career outcome ("North Star"), structured a strategic sitemap, and created an AGENTS.md master letter to guide implementation.

This project demonstrates:
- Strategic thinking before execution
- Intentional AI orchestration
- Clear recruiter-focused positioning
- Lightweight technical deployment via GitHub Pages


## Orchestration Log
The AI initially suggested heavier tooling, but I chose a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS setup so it deploys faster and cleaner on GitHub Pages. I also corrected a layout issue (content alignment) by adjusting the CSS to center sections and improve hierarchy
